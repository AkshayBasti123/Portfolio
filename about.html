      <h2>Hey, I’m Akshay</h2>
      <p>
        I’m someone who thrives on curiosity and creativity, always wanting to understand how things work and how they can be improved. From a young age, I’ve been drawn to technology, design, and problem-solving, building projects that not only function well but also feel engaging and meaningful. I love experimenting with new ideas, whether that means creating interactive websites, designing unique features that bring apps to life, or exploring ways technology can be used to protect and inspire people. For me, coding is more than just technical work; it’s a way to express creativity, challenge myself, and build experiences that connect with others.

        Over time, I’ve developed a strong set of skills in web development, cybersecurity concepts, and digital design. I enjoy taking on projects that push me to learn something new, whether it’s making a secure login system, designing a user-friendly interface, or adding creative touches like animations and interactive visuals. I’ve built projects that balance both functionality and personality, including apps that track progress in fun, visual ways and personal websites that combine design with storytelling. Every project is a chance to grow, refine my skills, and bring an idea from concept to reality.

        What sets me apart is my persistence and the mindset I bring to challenges. I don’t shy away from problems, I enjoy breaking them down, troubleshooting, and finding solutions that make sense. I’m passionate about the intersection of technology and people, and I aim to keep learning, building, and creating along the way. Whether it’s developing secure, thoughtful applications or designing experiences that leave an impression, I see technology as a tool for growth, connection, and impact.
